this analysis:\n","find the applicants that will be successful if funded by AlphabetSoup organisation.\n","\n","Results:\n",">using ReLU as the neural network activation function in starter_code .\n",">This function is very popular as it gives result close to 0 or 1.\n",">It doesnot activate all the neurons at the same time. the neurons will get deactivated when the output of linear transformation is less than 0 and therefore it will ignore negative values.\n","The sigmoid function:\n",">This is a non-linear activation function.\n",">The sigmoid transforms the values in the range of 0 and 1.\n","> since sigmoid is non linear only when there are multiple neurons with sigmoid function as result of this the output is non linear.\n","the sigmoid function is not symetric around zero so the output of sigmoid function is of the same sign.\n",">incontrast the tanh function is symmetric near 0 and so it uses a range from -1 to +1. the tanh function is better than sigmoid as the gradients are not restricted to move in certain direction.\n","\n","leaky_ReLU(LR):\n",">LR Is a variation of ReLu, it corrects the disadvantages of ReLU function. in Leaky ReLU(LR) function, we use a small linear component to the values that are less than 0 to activate the neurons.\n","\n","ELU activation function:\n",">Exponential linear unit that is unlike the LR and parametric ReLu, as it shows the negative values in the form of a logarithmic curve instead of straight line.\n","\n","Swish:\n",">This is a relatively new discovery by google . swish is computationally efficient and shows better performance than ReLU on deeper models. the swish ranges from -infinity to +infinity.\n","\n","Data Preprocessing:\n","1. the columns EIN and NAME were dropped.\n","2. the target for the model is the  the status or the is_successful column\n","3. the features of the model is the classification, application type, income_bracket, organisation, affiliation, ask_amount, special_consideration.\n","4. status was not a feature or target.\n","Compiling, training and evaluating model:\n","1. we selected 3 activaition layers.\n","2. when we use only 2 activation functions we can achieve 99% accuracy, whereas when we mix multiple linear and non linear activiation functions the accuracy reduced to 72%\n","3. increasing the activation layers increased the accuracy of the model performance.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WK-F_-fShIOi"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"id":"Pp3pbYDfdWqN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709632443262,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":619,"user":{"displayName":"Gayathri
